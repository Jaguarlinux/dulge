.Nm dulge
.Nd Introduction and concepts
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The X Binary Package System (DULGE) is a binary package system designed and implemented from scratch.
Its goal is to be fast, easy to use, bug-free, featureful and portable as much as possible.

The primary interface of DULGE is its suite of tools, including
.Xr dulge-install 1
for installing packages,
.Xr dulge-remove 1
for removing packages, and
.Xr dulge-query 1
for searching repositories and querying package properties.
A C library is also available, called
.Em libdulge .
.Sh PACKAGES
An DULGE package is a compressed archive of the package's files and metadata.

Packages can also include scripts that run during installation and removal, during the
.Dq configuration
phase.
These scripts can be re-run with
.Nm dulge-reconfigure Fl f .

Packages can be checked for issues with
.Xr dulge-pkgdb 1 .
If a package reports errors, it should be reinstalled with
.Nm dulge-install Fl f .

Packages can mark files as
.Em conf_files ,
which will prevent them from being replaced upon package update if modified.
.Sh PACKAGE EXPRESSIONS
Packages can be referred to in several ways.
A package expression is a form to match a pattern; currently dulge
supports 3 ways to specify them:
.Bl -dash
.It
by package name, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo .
.It
by exact package name and version, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo-1.0_1 .
.It
by specifying a package name and version separated by any of the following version comparators:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Sy <
less than
.It
.Sy >
greater than
.It
.Sy <=
less or equal than
.It
.Sy >=
greater or equal than
.Pp
Example:
.Dq Sy foo>=2.0 .
.El
.El
.Pp
The first repository matching the package expression wins.
.Sh PACKAGE MODES
An installed package can have some specific modes of operation.
Package modes can be changed with
.Xr dulge-pkgdb 1 .
Currently the following modes are available:
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Sy hold
The package is on hold mode.
Packages in this mode won't be updated unless
it's explicitely declared to be updated.
The only way to update packages in this mode is by using the
.Fl f , Fl -force
option.
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm dulge-query Fl H .
.It Sy manual
The package is in manual mode of installation and won't be considered for
removal when running
.Nm dulge-remove Fl o .
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm dulge-query Fl m .
.It Sy repolock
A package in repolock mode will only accept updates that are available in the
same repository that was used for installing.
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm dulge-query Fl -list-repolock-pkgs .
.El
.Sh REPOSITORIES
An DULGE repository is a directory containing DULGE packages and an
.Em <arch>-repodata
repository index file.
If the repository is remote (served via a web server), packages must be RSA-signed.

In DULGE configuration and command-line flags, repositories are specified by a complete url or absolute path to the directory where the
.Em <arch>-repodata
resides.
To synchronize configured remote repositories locally, use
.Nm dulge-install Fl S .

Repositories are created and managed with
.Xr dulge-rindex 1 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/db/dulge/.<pkgname>-files.plist
.It Ar /etc/dulge.d
Default configuration directory.
